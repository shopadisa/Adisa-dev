Look at the following resource compiled by Shopify.com for Liquid HTML.
The resource contains general description of the language, and gives helpful examples of different features.

Resource: JavaScript
This is a compliation of useful resources when it comes to learning the fundamentals of Javascript.
First: Codeacademy is an excellent free resource that allows you to learn and get hands on experience by completing challenges in the language of your choosing. I believe that you have to make a free account to use it, but it is completely worth it.

W3 schools is also an excellent resource, and is more about documentation and reading rather than challenges, though they have lots of interactable examples.

Both of these resources can be used for learning other languages as well.
Another website that has excellent challenges after the fundamentals of javascript are grasped is codebyte:

Here you can complete more complex challenges, with time elements involved. Unfortunately, past the first 10 easy challenges you have to pay either $24 a month or $100 for the year to use their services, which is probably not worth it.
